today i learnt how to un do using Ctrl Z.

you can put anything in a loop. For example,

```
y=1
while y < 1001:
  print('yash')
  y=y+1
```

will print yash 100 times.

Also, you can give multiple values to print(), like this

```
print('yash', 1, 'kurdekar')
```

Today I learnt how to copy, cut and paste using Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X and Ctrl+V.

Also "select all", which is Ctrl+A.

This is how you write a loop in Python:

```
y=1
while y < 1001:
  print(y)
  y=y+1
```

I even learnt how to set a bookmark in the browser.
